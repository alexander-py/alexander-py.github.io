# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex

> Data Engineer by day, car fanatic by night ⚡



## 💫 About Me

I transform caffeine into data pipelines. Currently crafting robust workflows with Apache Airflow and making data flow like Lake Michigan.

## 🛠️ Tech I Enjoy
```hcl
resource "engineer" "alexander_stefanov" {
  orchestration     = "Apache Airflow"
  data_processing  = ["Python", "SQL"]
  cloud_computing  = ["AWS", "Azure"]
  iac            = "Come on, it's obvious"
  mindset          = "Data-driven decisions"
}
```

## 📈 What I Do

- 🌊 Build data pipelines that never sleep
- 🎯 Turn messy data into actionable insights
- ⚙️ Automate all the things
- 🔍 Drop all databases

## 🤔 Ruminations

> "How come after all these years, Airflow is still in public preview in Azure? And just one very old version?"

> "At least the naming in Azure is more straightforwad. EC2 vs ..VMs? Lambda vs ..Functions?"

> "Airflow DAGs are like recipes - they should be simple and repeatable."
